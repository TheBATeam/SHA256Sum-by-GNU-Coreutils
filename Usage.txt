Usage: sha256sum.exe [OPTION] [FILE]...
Print or check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -b, --binary            read in binary mode (default unless reading tty stdin)
  -c, --check             read SHA256 sums from the FILEs and check them
  -t, --text              read in text mode (default if reading tty stdin)

The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:
      --status            don't output anything, status code shows success
  -w, --warn              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print
a line with checksum, a character indicating type (`*' for binary, ` ' for
text), and name for each FILE.
